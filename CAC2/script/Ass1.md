# Nom du jeu : Iris
# Data du jeux de donnée 
# A small classic dataset from Fisher, 1936. One of the earliest known datasets used for evaluating classification methods.
# Dataset information
#What do the instances in this dataset represent?

Each instance is a plant

Additional Information

This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

This is an exceedingly simple domain.

This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net ).  The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.
